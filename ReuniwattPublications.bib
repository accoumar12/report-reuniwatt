abstract = {Considering the ever-growing volume of data acquired and transmitted by satellites, a major challenge is to have enough space-to-ground communication capabilities to offer a fitted broadcast service. Optical technologies offer several advantages compared to the more conventional radio communications. They enable higher throughput and increased confidentiality without encroaching on the already saturated radio spectrum. However, these systems are vulnerable to atmospheric turbulences and even more so to cloud cover, which can completely block the transmission of the laser through the atmosphere. To guarantee the availability of the system, it is necessary to work with networks of optical ground stations (OGS) distributed geographically in order to keep at least one terminal under clear sky conditions. The design of such OGS networks (size, location, etc.) is generally based on cloud statistics calculated from geostationary satellites such as MSG/SEVIRI. While satellite data offer a global coverage, they have a quite coarse spatial resolution of around 4 kilometres in the middle latitude regions. In this work, we propose to compare the cloud statistics derived from MSG/SEVIRI and the observations of a Sky InSight™, a ground-based wide-angle device designed by Reuniwatt which observes in the long-wave infrared band (8-14 μm). Located in Toulouse, this instrument allows day and night cloud observations with an increased spatial resolution compared to satellite data. Discrepancies between the two cloud observation data sources are discussed and a global estimation of the achievable throughput is computed for both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary Orbit (GEO) optical link scenarios.},

title = {Day-ahead forecasting of regional photovoltaic production using deep learning},
abstract = {Power production based on solar energy is directly related to the state of the atmosphere. As the atmospheric state is undergone, this connection makes the solar energy a non-dispatchable source as opposed to controllable renewable sources such as hydroelectricity. In a context of growing photovoltaic generation, accurate forecast tools at regional scale are then increasingly important to grid operators. Indeed, forecasts allow to get information about the future production over the next minutes, hours and days. Forecasting tools offer the possibility of a better grid management strategy specifically for transmission system operator (TSO) that are responsible for balancing renewable power production. High forecast accuracy could also lead to reduced costs for energy trading.
In the light of this situation, this study focuses on the development and analysis of a regional forecasting tool based on a deep learning approach. The selected model consists in a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a long short-term memory architecture (LSTM). The CNN layers allow to extract spatial features from Numerical Weather Prediction outputs while the LSTM part supports the temporal relationship. The day-ahead regional forecast for Germany is chosen as a case study.
The CNN-LSTM is compared to the classical Random Forest model known to be one of the reference techniques for this kind of problematic. Simpler deep learning models are also tested to validate the improvement brought by the CNN-LSTM architecture. All the comparisons are based on the classical root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics. The main result of this study shows that CNN-LSTM model can improve forecast accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art Random Forest. As expected, this improvement is strongly correlated to the amount of historical data which must cover several years according to the sensitivity study realized in this work.},

abstract = {Measurement of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is important for the assessment of potential beneficial and adverse impacts on the biosphere, plants, animals, and humans. Excess solar UVR exposure in humans is associated with skin carcinogenesis and immunosuppression. Several factors influence solar UVR at the Earth\&rsquo;s surface, such as latitude and cloud cover. Given the potential risks from solar UVR there is a need to measure solar UVR at different locations using effective instrumentation. Various instruments are available to measure solar UVR, but some are expensive and others are not portable, both restrictive variables for exposure assessments. Here, we compared solar UVR sensors commercialized at low or moderate cost to assess their performance and quality of measurements against a high-grade Bentham spectrometer. The inter-comparison campaign took place between March 2018 and February 2019 at Saint-Denis, La R\&eacute;union. Instruments evaluated included a Kipp\&amp;Zonen UVS-E-T radiometer, a Solar Light UV-Biometer, a SGLux UV-Cosine radiometer, and a Davis radiometer. Cloud fraction was considered using a SkyCamVision all-sky camera and the Tropospheric Ultraviolet Visible radiative transfer model was used to model clear-sky conditions. Overall, there was good reliability between the instruments over time, except for the Davis radiometer, which showed dependence on solar zenith angle. The Solar Light UV-Biometer and the Kipp\&amp;Zonen radiometer gave satisfactory results, while the low-cost SGLux radiometer performed better in clear sky conditions. Future studies should investigate temporal drift and stability over time.},

abstract = {Offgrid systems delivering power in isolated areas (industrial mining sites, rural or insular inhabitations) are increasingly fuelled by hybrid PV-Diesel systems. Fuel consumption is costly and oil can be randomly variable. Moreover, transportation of fuel in remote areas can induce accident or thieves. Finally, decreasing the use of fuel contribute efficiently to greenhouses gases emission reduction. Maximizing the PV power integration while fulfilling the demand is critical for such micro-grid operators. The objectives of this work consist in assessing the benefits of cloud nowcasting to reduce the fuel consumption for different load profiles (residential and/or industrial). We used a nowcasting method based on images processing of a ground sky imager. The thermal-infrared whole sky imager Sky InsightTM designed by Reuniwatt, has unique advantages for an accurate very short-term forecasting of surface solar irradiance: its automatic distinction of cloud from clear sky is very robust whatever the position of the Sun in the sky; a non-dazzling effect from sunlight enables to forecast sudden PV production drop in the next few minutes through a clear distinction of the clouds surrounding the Sun; a capacity from a single observation point to retrieve and forecast a complete solar surface irradiance map.},

url = {https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/366307},
abstract = {The growth of the global total installed photovoltaic capacity is accompanied by an increasing need for more accurate short-term solar power forecasts. Those are especially important in the tropics where the solar potential and the intermittency of solar irradiance reach their maximum. One example is Reunion Island (21°S, 55°E) in the South-West Indian Ocean (SWIO) where renewables shall cover 50\% of the energy production by 2020. In the SWIO pronounced convection over the ocean makes short-term cloud and solar irradiance forecasting challenging.

Limited-area numerical weather prediction (NWP) models (LAMs) have the potential to forecast cloud and radiation processes in the order of kilometres and minutes. Nevertheless, their irradiance forecast accuracy largely depends on the initial conditions. As conventional in-situ observations are sparse in the SWIO, meteorological geostationary satellites provide valuable observations which can frequently be assimilated into LAMs.

In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and the ensemble Kalman Filter of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) are applied to the SWIO. The boundary conditions of the 40 member WRF ensemble are provided by the Global Ensemble Forecast System.

For the first time multi-phase (ice, supercooled and liquid) water path retrievals of NASA Langley’s Satellite ClOud and Radiation Property retrieval System (SatCORPS) cloud products are assimilated using the DART cloud water path forward operator.

Cycling experiments with and without data assimilation (DA) have been performed over several weeks in austral summer 2017/18. Independent radio soundings are used to evaluate the impact of the satellite DA on the analysis. Moreover, an assessment of irradiance forecasts is performed using ground-based irradiance observations at 13 sites on Reunion Island.

The ice water path retrievals have the highest impact on the analyses which leads to an improvement of the WRF humidity profile. The applied DA methodology improves short-term (up to 24 hours) irradiance forecasts by up to 10\% in terms of RMSE.

The performed experiments provide a first evaluation of ensemble-based multi-phase CWP DA using LAMs. This work is a step forward towards improved short-term tropical solar irradiance forecasts.},

This issue is even more critical in non-interconnected territories where network stability is an absolute necessity and the injection of PV power has to be limited. The basis for precise cloud evolution and subsequent irradiance forecasts are high quality atmospheric analyses for NWP. Geostationary meteorological satellites provide valuable observations of cloud properties with high spatio-temporal resolutions and allow a pertinent data assimilation. The shortcoming is that optical and thermal channels of satellite sensors do not provide cloud properties from inside clouds. Different existing data assimilation approaches aim at deriving atmospheric analyses with most realistic cloud features, utilising geostationary satellite observations. The potential of assimilating satellite-derived cloud information in regional NWP with focus on irradiance forecasts in tropical regions has not been evaluated so far. Hence, the present work aims at evaluating the potential of geostationary satellite data assimilation in limited-area models applied to the French tropical oversea territories Reunion Island and French Guiana.},

title = {Enhanced solar power forecasting in the tropics using satellite data assimilation},
abstract = {The current worldwide transition from conventional to renewable energy goes along with an expected increase of the installed photovoltaic (PV) capacity. Since renewable energies like PV are intermittent, solar forecasting is required in order to ensure grid stability and enables a massive injection of solar power into the electricity grids.
The high availability of solar irradiance in the tropics allows high yields of PV power. Nevertheless, enhanced convection, homogenous air masses and strong thermal contrasts between land and sea make cloud evolution highly uncertain and cause a pronounced variability of irradiance in the tropics. Especially in non-interconnected tropical areas this leads to the fact that the injection of renewable energies currently has to be capped in order to ensure grid stability. From this, arises the necessity for accurate irradiance forecasts in these areas. 
Compared to global weather models which typically provide irradiance in intervals of three hours, regional NWP models allow irradiance modelling on temporal and spatial scales which are much higher and therefore more appropriate for solar power forecasting needs. The basis for accurate irradiance and cloud evolution forecasts is an accurate analysis of the atmospheric state for the initialisation of the regional NWP model. Such analyses are obtained by data assimilation methods which statistically combine observations and background information. 
Geostationary satellites provide reliable radiometric signatures of clouds and moreover high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, which is especially beneficial in data-sparse regions like islands. The shortcoming is that a great number of observations have to be neglected in the course of satellite data assimilation since optical and thermal channels of satellite sensors do not provide cloud properties from inside clouds and since the single observations are highly correlated. This work aims at finding an assimilation strategy which makes optimal use of the available satellite observations in the assimilation process. We evaluate for the first time the potential of satellite data assimilation in regional NWP regarding short-term solar irradiance forecasts in the tropics. Therefore, numerical experiments using the models COSMO and WRF in conjunction with state-of-the-art data assimilation methods are performed. Special attention is drawn to the interplay of nesting and satellite data assimilation, satellite channel selection, bias correction and observation error treatment. 
The regions of study are two French tropical oversea territories: Reunion Island (21°S, 55°E), and French Guiana (5°N, 52°W).},

Images from visible channels of MTSAT-2 are presently used for the mapping of solar surface radiation over Japan and Australia. The present version uses climatological ground albedo maps to model MTSAT-2 pixel reflectance under clear sky conditions. This process permits to characterize ground albedo without using a long-term time series of MTSAT-2, avoiding high costs of archive purchase and large dataset management. Implementation takes benefit of a geographic web server permitting a convenient and interoperable use of different geolocated data respecting the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Accuracy of GHI values has been quantified by comparing them with pyranometer measurements from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations located in Japan. Results are close to the ones obtained with the equivalent model used with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) data over Europe. The paper concludes on the generic aspect of this model.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic power production relies upon solar radiation received at ground level, that remains difficult to predict. Accurate forecast of surface solar irradiance is essential for grid operators in order to accommodate this intermittent energy in their scheduling, dispatching and regulation of power. Surface solar irradiance forecasting methods can be described as the prediction of the cloud physical property over a specific area. This information is then combined with the value of the irradiance under a clear sky for the same area at the same forecast time. Then, uncertainty of irradiance under clear sky can affect significantly the forecast results accuracy. Many clear sky models have been designed and are routinely used to compute surface solar irradiance under a sky with no cloud for a diversity of applications. The required inputs for such tools are varying from model to another. The simplest models just take into account the solar elevation, while more detailed ones may include other inputs such as concentration of atmospheric components (aerosols, water vapor, ozone), elevation of the site, ground albedo, in order to represent a realistic atmosphere transmittance. However, availability and quality of some inputs are not always guaranteed at every locations. The objective of our study is the selection and performance quantification of a clear sky model usable with an innovative solar radiation forecasting tool. We selected the models Bird, Solis, ESRA and McClear. These models demonstrated their accuracy and robustness and their features are suitable for operational processes. We undertook our study over three sites located in Corsica, French Guiana and Reunion Island. We collected available atmospheric parameters (aerosol optical depth and water vapour). We compared simulated global irradiation with ground measurements at clear sky situations. Models accuracy and their sensitivity to input data are discussed. Conclusions underline the input data quality requirements.},

abstract = {Day and night cloud cover observation and short term forecasting from the ground is useful for several research applications such as small-scale weather-modelling processes, long-term records of local processes for climate change studies or clear sky events notification. Other societal applications are concerned: short-term solar energy forecast, air-traffic management, ground-satellite communications… Solutions to observe cloud properties already exist: human observations, radiometry and active instruments (radar and lidar). Each of these techniques have their own advantages but none of them are able to provide a day and night continuous vision of the entire sky vault at a reasonable price. Observation with all-sky imagers (ASI) is an affordable and simple solution to observe the full sky vault and forecast cloud cover in the next 30 minutes. Many ASI are available on the market, producing sky images in the visible spectra. However, observations are limited to daytime and images are often affected by Sun dazzling effects.

The Sky Insight™ thermal infrared imager, designed by Reuniwatt, is an ASI observing in the long-wave infrared band (7-14 µm) using a camera mounted with an uncooled array of microbolometers. It permits to obtain a continuous observation of the sky (night and day) without sunglare with a constant observation quality by day and night. From the measured cloud emittance it enables to retrieve cloud-base temperature (CBT), cloud-base height (CBH) and cloud-optical depth (COD).

In this work, we present a CBH retrieval method from the Sky Insight™ using a machine learning approach with collocated ceilometer measurements. Using a nearby atmospheric profile, the CBH derived from ceilometer observations is converted into CBT. Then, a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) is trained with: the Sky InSight™ numerical count, the collocated numerical count simulated under clear sky condition, air temperature measured at surface level and the CBT derived from the ceilometer. Once trained, the ANN method is used to convert a set of input data into CBT. This CBT is then converted into CBH using the current nearby radiosounding.

About 6 months of these calculated CBHs have been compared to those from a ceilometer. Both observations are temporally integrated on a 30 second basis. Standard deviation error between ceilometer measurements and Sky InSight™ retrieval is about 300 meters when ceilometers indicates a CBH below 3000m. Further works are ongoing to validate CBH at other viewing zenith angles of the sky vault.},

title = {Intraday cloud cover forecasting using geostationary meteorological satellite images},
url = {https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Paper/403958},
abstract = {Cloud cover forecasts at very short term (up to 6 hours) are useful for solar energy management but also for any application requiring cloud cover at local scale (airport traffic management, low orbit satellite mission planning, defense application…). In particular, photovoltaic production is strongly dependent on cloud cover behavior. It can induce a very high variability of the production which is problematic for a safe and gainful feed-in to the power grid. This issue is even more critical in non-interconnected territories where network stability is an absolute necessity.

In this context, grid operators of such areas must mitigate the risk of this variability. Intraday irradiance forecasting is useful to plan the energy mix. In particular, the PV power drop probability in the next hours allows a convenient sizing of power reserves. At this time scale, cloud cover evolves with a stochastic behaviour not properly represented in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Analysing cloud motion using images from geostationary meteorological satellites is a well-known alternative to forecasting surface solar irradiance (SSI) up to 6 hours ahead with a better accuracy than NWP models.

In this study, we present and apply our satellite-based solar irradiance forecasting methods. Firstly, we present the ability to assess solar irradiance over more than 100 sites all over the world. Then, we evaluate our solar irradiance forecast scheme on measurements sites located in the field of view of the satellite Himawari-8 (Ishigakijima, Japan), MSG-4 (Carpentras, France) and MSG-1 (Reunion Island). In particular, we converted 12 months of images from each satellite into cloud index maps. Then, we applied an algorithm computing a cloud motion vector field from a short sequence of consecutive images. Comparisons between forecasted SSI at a lead time of 2 hours and collocated pyranometric measurements show a relative RMSE between 22 and 27\%. In addition, we propose metrics that can take into account the score of drop detection and its timestamp error.},

abstract = {Shallow cumulus clouds play an important role in surface energy budget and in transport of moisture, momentum and pollution from boundary layer to the free troposphere. These small, optically thin, short lived clouds have large variations in both time and space. Modeling of shallow cumulus clouds remains a significant challenge in global climate models and is of particular interest for solar forecasting. Simulations or parameterizations of shallow cumulus fields require measurements of several relevant quantities for validation. Here, we use Doppler wind lidar vertical velocity measurements to study key quantities related to the formation and maintenance of these clouds that need to be modeled properly. We characterize updraft fraction, coherent plume heights, plume width and mass flux velocity associated with these clouds. Doppler lidar measurements were made at Indianapolis, Indiana and the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site located in north-central Oklahoma. We compare and contrast these characteristics at the two locations in central United States that are particularly well suited for observations of shallow cumulus clouds. This analysis will extend previous similar analysis at the SGP central site to Indianapolis, Indiana, providing important information on regional variability.},

abstract = {The Heliosat-4 method estimates the surface downwelling shortwave radiation (DSSR) received at ground level in all sky conditions. It is composed of two parts: the McClear model calculating the irradiance under cloud-free conditions and the McCloud model calculating the extinction of irradiance due to clouds. The main inputs to McClear are aerosol properties, total column water vapor and ozone content provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). As for McCloud the cloud properties are retrieved from multispectral analysis of images of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites using dedicated algorithms. The flexibility of Heliosat-4 (H4) offers the possibility to integrate different sources of cloud properties. In this work, three databases have been implemented to H4. The first one is the APOLLO (AVHRR Processing scheme Over cLouds, Land and Ocean) database from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) which is implemented in the framework of the CAMS Radiation service. The second one is the MSG-CPP product issued by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). The third cloud property dataset is the CLAAS-2 dataset generated by the German DWD in the framework of CM-SAF. A new and fourth one called SICLONE (Système d’Information pour l’analyse et la prévision des Configurations spatio-temporelLes des Occurrences NuageusEs) has been produced by Reuniwatt, containing cloud retrieval properties calculated with the NWC-SAF software. In this study, the feasibility of connecting different cloud property databases to H4 along with the sensitivity of the method to the input cloud properties are tested. To this end, the cloud properties of the different databases are first compared. The DSSR calculated with H4 with the different datasets are then compared. Here, solar radiation evaluated by KNMI with their inversion algorithm is considered to also get an insight on the impact of the method on the estimation. Pyranometer measurements from the BSRN and KNMI networks for the year 2016 are used for this analysis.},

The assimilation of cloud water path (CWP) retrievals from geostationary satellites using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) led to improved short-term GHI forecasts of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in midlatitudes in case studies. An evaluation of the method under tropical conditions and a quantification of this improvement for study periods of more than a few days are still missing. This paper focuses on the assimilation of CWP retrievals in three phases (ice, supercooled, and liquid) in a 6-hourly cycling procedure and on the impact of this method on short-term forecasts of GHI for Réunion Island, a tropical island in the southwest Indian Ocean. The multilayer gridded cloud properties of NASA Langley's Satellite ClOud and Radiation Property retrieval System (SatCORPS) are assimilated using the EnKF of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) Manhattan release (revision 12002) and the advanced research WRF (ARW) v3.9.1.1. The ability of the method to improve cloud analyses and GHI forecasts is demonstrated, and a comparison using independent radiosoundings shows a reduction of specific humidity bias in the WRF analyses, especially in the low and middle troposphere. Ground-based GHI observations at 12 sites on Réunion Island are used to quantify the impact of CWP DA. Over a total of 44 d during austral summertime, when averaged over all sites, CWP data assimilation has a positive impact on GHI forecasts for all lead times between 5 and 14 h. Root mean square error and mean absolute error are reduced by 4 \% and 3 \%, respectively.},

abstract = {The variability of solar irradiance necessitates to limit the instantaneous feed-in of solar power to electricity grids. An improvement of solar irradiance forecasts would allow to increase the defined threshold limits, especially in non-interconnected zones such as Reunion Island. Achieving higher forecast accuracy is particularly challenging in the case of tropical islands due to pronounced convection and local thermal circulations. Limited-area numerical weather prediction (NWP) models allow to forecast cloud processes and solar irradiance at high spatio-temporal resolutions of a few kilometres and minutes. Nevertheless, they often fail to accurately predict cloudiness evolution and thus tend to overestimate solar irradiance. Refining the initial conditions of regional models in terms of clouds is an efficient means for improving short-term cloud cover and irradiance forecasts. The assimilation of geostationary meteorological satellite observations can achieve this improvement. Nevertheless, a variety of satellite data assimilation (DA) approaches exist and research has focused on mid-latitudes so far. This thesis deals with the assimilation of geostationary satellite observations with limited-area models in the southwestern Indian Ocean. In a first step, the state of the art in terms of existing approaches for radiance and cloud property retrieval assimilation with regional-scale models is reviewed. In consequence, one of the most promising approaches is identified and applied to the southwestern Indian Ocean. In the performed experiments, multi-phase cloud water path retrievals from NASA Langley's SatCORPS cloud products are assimilated with an ensemble Kalman filter using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. A 41-member ensemble at 12 km grid spacing is applied with a DA cycling interval of 6 hours. The Data Assimilation Research Testbed and its forward operator for cloud water path are used to assimilate gridded cloud water retrievals in the ice, supercooled liquid, and liquid phase. The impact of this assimilation approach on forecasts of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is evaluated for austral summer 2017/2018 using pyranometer observations on Reunion Island. A distinct positive impact of the applied method on the first 14 hours of GHI forecasts is found. Different aspects of the forecast improvement due to DA are analysed by means of control experiments without DA, experiments with a nested domain at 4 km grid spacing, and a comparison with operational NWP models. As the utilised gridded cloud products are available globally, the method offers a portable and globally applicable approach that may also be evaluated for other regions of the Earth.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic production is mostly driven by the solar irradiance received at ground level. Forecasting surface solar irradiance remains to predict the cloudiness and combine it with the value of the irradiance modeled under a clear sky for the same area at the same forecast horizon. Thus, uncertainty of irradiance under clear sky can affect significantly the photovoltaic production forecast. Clear sky irradiance can be accurately computed if concentration of some atmospheric components (aerosol, water vapor and ozone) are sufficiently known above a location. Many clear sky models have been designed allowing a various number of inputs. In this work, we analyzed the performance of four different clear sky models. We compared their outputs against ground measurements located in Reunion Island, Corsica and French Guiana. We used the models with atmospheric parameters provided by two different sources (neighboring ground measurements and reanalysis). Best results lead to a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 3 \% and an absolute relative mean bias error (rMBE) less than 1 \%, for minutely irradiance. Using atmospheric parameters from reanalysis instead of punctual measurements significantly reduces errors in clear sky models.},

abstract = {Cloud-resolving numerical weather prediction (NWP) models allow to forecast cloud processes at high spatio-temporal resolutions of a few kilometres and minutes. Nevertheless, they often fail to accurately predict cloudiness evolution which affects the prediction of severe weather events as well as solar irradiance. Refining the initial conditions of regional-scale models in terms of clouds using data assimilation is an efficient means for improving short-term cloud cover and irradiance forecasts. The growing amount of sky cameras offers frequently updated cloud observations that are not used in data assimilation so far. Both visible- and infrared-wavelength range images of the sky are considered in this work. The infrared images are obtained from Reuniwatt’s thermal infrared all-sky imager Sky InSight. This all-sky camera is already used for minute-scale PV production forecasting around the globe. It allows the retrieval of cloud parameters such as cloud fraction, cloud-base height, or cloud type at day and night time with a constant accuracy. Moreover, the German Weather Service operates multiple high-resolution webcams all over Germany, that offer visible-range cloud observations. The aim of this work is to detect cloud features from the visible and infrared camera images of the sky and to explore how that would translate into forward operators based on artificial intelligence. Different approaches for cloud data assimilation are evaluated within the framework of the models WRF and ICON over Germany.},

title = {Remote sensing of atmospheric winds using an infrared all-sky imager},
abstract = {The motion of clouds at a given location can be detected using ground-based all-sky imagers that frequently acquire images of the sky dome. Motion flow is used for minute-scale forecasting of cloud cover and solar irradiance, for example in the case of forecasting photovoltaic power production. While visible-range sky cameras are often applied for this purpose, they neither allow to detect the altitude of clouds, nor accurately detect clouds at night time. However, thermal-infrared all-sky imagers, such as Reuniwatt’s Sky InSight, retrieve brightness temperatures with constant accuracy at day and night time. This allows for the retrieval of diverse cloud parameters such as cloud base height. Atmospheric wind vectors can be derived and geolocalised by combining cloud motion detection and cloud-base height retrieval. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of atmospheric wind vector retrievals by the means of the Sky InSight. Radiosoundings and wind profiler observations are used as a reference.},
