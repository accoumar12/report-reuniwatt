For day-ahead forecasts, the combination of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and post-processing algorithms is the most effective method.

However, it is hard to extract from all the literature on the subject the best algorithm to use because of the lack of consistency in the different approaches.\\ 

During my internship, my mission was to investigate the best algorithms according to the literature so as to improve the day-ahead irradiance forecasts. 

My final results demonstrated improved metrics in comparison to the current algorithm used by Reuniwatt.
